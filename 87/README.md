User experience design


&nbsp;

### Notes ‚úçÔ∏è
- Simplicity
	- Don't put a ton of information all on one screen. Focus the user's attention on only a few elements.
- Consistency
	- An example, many sites have a navbar that totally changes based on where the user is (if the user is not registered you see a navbar if you register the navbar changes color and buttons if the user goes down the menu the navbar changes again). Maintain consistency in the elements you build.
- Reading patterns
	- F-Layout or Z-Layout. For example, elements can be shown to the user as if he were reading a book, from top to bottom, from left to right.
- All platform design
	- Make your design responsive to designated devices, making the most of available space.
