# Exercise 1: Describe Problem
def my_function():
   for i in range(1, 20):
     if i == 20:

# Solution 1: "You got it" is never printed as the range goes from 1 to 19. To solve it, just set range (1, 21)

dice_imgs = ["‚ù∂", "‚ù∑", "‚ù∏", "‚ùπ", "‚ù∫", "‚ùª"]
dice_num = randint(1, 6)
print(dice_imgs[dice_num])
# Solution 2: The randint function generates a random number between 1 and 6. The elements of the list start at index 0. So they will have indexes from 0 to 5.
# If random number 6 is generated it will result in an error. The solution is randint(0, 5)

# Exercise 4: Fix the Errors
age = int(input("How old are you?"))

# Solution 4: input returns a string that you can compare against an integer. To solve, just set age = int(input (....))
# Also the print must be an f string, print(f"...")

# Exercise 5: Print is Your Friend

# Sulution 5: The word_per_page line has == which is a comparison not an assignment. Just put an =. Furthermore, the print must be done with f string
